# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation. This guide will help you understand and use the project effectively.

## Overview

This project is built with:

- **Jaspr** - Modern Dart web framework
- **Arcane UI** - Supabase-inspired component library
- **Static Generation** - Pre-rendered for performance

## Why Use This?

### Performance

Static sites load instantly. No server-side rendering on each request means your users get content immediately.

### Developer Experience

Write documentation in Markdown. The build process handles everything else - syntax highlighting, navigation, table of contents.

### Customization

Built on Arcane UI, you have access to 76+ components for extending your docs with interactive elements.

## Next Steps
