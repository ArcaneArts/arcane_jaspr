# Arcane Jaspr

A comprehensive UI component library built for [Jaspr](https://jaspr.dev), bringing the elegance of modern design systems to Dart web development.

## What is Arcane Jaspr?

Arcane Jaspr is the web implementation of the Arcane UI design system. It provides over 75 production-ready components that render to semantic HTML with CSS styling, giving you complete control over your application's look and feel.

Whether you're building a documentation site, a dashboard, or a full-featured web application, Arcane Jaspr gives you the building blocks to ship faster without sacrificing quality.

## Key Features

**Type-Safe Styling** - Use `ArcaneStyleData` for compile-time verified CSS properties, or drop down to raw CSS when you need full control.

**Dark-First Design** - Every component looks great in both light and dark modes out of the box. Theming is built into the core, not bolted on.

**Semantic HTML** - Components render to proper HTML elements with accessibility in mind. No div soup here.

**Firebase Auth Ready** - Built-in authentication components and guards for Firebase, so you can add login flows in minutes.
